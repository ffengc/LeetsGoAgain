# LeetsGoAgain

- [English](./README.md)
- [‰∏≠Êñá](./README-CN.md)

In June 2025, I started systematically solving LeetCode problems. I had already practiced a few hundred problems back in my freshman year, but since I didn‚Äôt study algorithms in a structured way back then, I‚Äôve forgotten quite a bit over the years.

This repository is created to record and motivate my progress, as well as to keep track of the problems I‚Äôve solved. I plan to go through them in Chinese first, and later switch to English.
